  <h2 style="color: #004080;">Our Beliefs</h2>

  <p>We are a Bible-believing church that stands for the full restoration of the Word of God in this end-time. 
  We believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8), and that His unchanging Word has been revealed to prepare the Bride of Christ for His soon coming.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #004080;">The Bible</h3>
  <p>We believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God, infallible and complete, and that every doctrine must be measured by the Scriptures.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #004080;">Godhead</h3>
  <p>We believe there is one true God who revealed Himself as Father in creation, as Son in redemption, and as the Holy Spirit in the Church today.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #004080;">Salvation</h3>
  <p>We believe that salvation comes by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, made possible by His death and resurrection. Water baptism should be performed in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to Acts 2:38.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #004080;">The End-Time Message</h3>
  <p>We believe that God sent a prophet messenger, according to Malachi 4:5-6 and Revelation 10:7, to call the Bride of Christ back to the original Word and prepare her for the rapture. We receive the message of this hour as a continuation of the work of the Holy Spirit through the ministry of Brother William Marrion Branham.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #004080;">The Second Coming</h3>
  <p>We believe that the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is at hand, and that the Bride is being called out and made ready for the great marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>

  <p style="margin-top: 30px;">We invite you to fellowship with us as we worship in Spirit and in truth, walking in the light of the revealed Word for this generation.</p>
